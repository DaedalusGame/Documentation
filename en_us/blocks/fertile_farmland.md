![Fertile Farmland](block:betterwithmods:fertile_farmland)

Fertile Farmland is used to accelerate plant growth by putting Bonemeal into the soil.
The fertilizer will randomly get used up the plant and have to be readd, unless you are using a [Planter](planter.md)
{hcbonemeal?Due to HCBonemeal this is the only way to use bonemeal:     }
